# Java-Exercises

This repertoire includes various Java exercises and puzzles with varying degrees of difficulty. 
I do these mostly in my spare time and would like to observe my development a bit and get into code management.

It contains two folders:

challenging:
  - Largest Prime Factor
  - Longest Palindrome in a Word

moderate:
  - Caesar Cypher
  - Even Fibonacci Sums
  - Rice bag problem
